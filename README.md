# Throw

## Description

This is a Full Stack Web Application Project I am currently working on for Track and Field athletes to better manage
and process training data. The tech stack is a PERN stack of Postgre SQL, Express, React, Node.
I have currently implemented the REST API for the Frontend to communicate with the Database, as well as some functionalities of the FrontEnd.
The Throws Squad with Track and Field at UBC has Alpha tested the app at a local level.
